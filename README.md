The aim of this paper is to predict marks for Mathematics and Portuguese Language exams in secondary school. This investigation will focus on evaluating the results obtained using two supervised learning algorithms, Multilayer Perceptron and Support Vector Machines, which are aiming to solve a regression problem. Both of the models use KFold Cross Validation and Grid Search as optimisation techniques. This study also includes an evaluation of these two different approaches focusing on R-squared values and learning curves.
